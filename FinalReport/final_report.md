## Data Preparation

### Data Overview

The fastq data is generated by the software [dwgsim](https://github.com/nh13/DWGSIM) written by `Nils Homer`. The parameters are set as default except the sequencing error rate (in order to simulate high-quality sequencing data, mimicing real data). 3 pair-end datasets are generated based on human genome `hg38` with different read length, namely 50, 70 and 100 bp respectively.

### data regeneration

To regenerate the data, run pbs file on `PBS/HW1-1_DataSimulation/HW1-1_DataSimulation.pbs`

```shell
qsub PBS/HW1-1_DataSimulation/HW1-1_DataSimulation.pbs

# for personal computer, run as shell script:
# bash PBS/HW1-1_DataSimulation/HW1-1_DataSimulation.pbs
```

### detailed parameters

| parameter | value |
|-----------|-------|
| error rate | 0.0007 (quality score ~31.5) |
| number of reads | 100000 |
| random seed | 1063 (course number) |
| outer distance between two ends for pairs | mean 500, stddev 50|
| mutation rate | 0.1% |
| indel fraction | 0.1 |
| random DNA read fraction | 5% |
| number of Ns in a read | maximum 0 |
| stddev for base quality score | 50 |
